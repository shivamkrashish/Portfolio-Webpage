      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
      I am a passionate Web Developer with a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, and full-stack development. As a fresher, I have independently built multiple real-world projects, including interactive games, API-based applications, and dynamic web solutions.

I have demonstrated academic excellence, securing 3rd rank in my university exams during the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd semesters and 5th rank in the 4th semester and 5th semester. My problem-solving skills, dedication to learning, and hands-on experience with modern technologies make me a strong candidate for web development roles.

I am always eager to learn new technologies, collaborate on exciting projects, and contribute to impactful web solutions.
